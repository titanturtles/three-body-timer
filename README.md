# three body timer

This is an electron project to mimic the countdown timer in The Three-Body Problem novel.

## TODO

* Could not find a font that satifies me
* Need to record the current status
* Can add a variation that the time will try to avoid mouse pointer, and when mouse is away, it will go back to center

## To Run It

ELectron project uses nodejs and can be managed by `npm`.

Run the following command to start:
```
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```

## To Compile It

I actually too lazy to put it here. A generic compilation tutorial for electron project should work.
